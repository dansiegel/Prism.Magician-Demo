# Prism Magician - Demo

When you run this app, you'll notice this is an extremely basic app. This is meant only to show off some of the basics about working with the Prism Magician.

This app seamlessly integrates Shiny Lib with Prism 8, and provides base ViewModels with both Prism's BindableBase and ReactiveUI's ReactiveObject, there are no services or views explicitly registered in the app as this is entirely handled at build time to further increase performance.

## Supported Platforms

While this application demonstrates the Prism Magician working with Prism for Xamarin.Forms, the Magician also works Prism for both WPF and Uno Platform.

## Getting the Prism Magician

The Prism Magician is exclusively available to my GitHub Sponsors through [SponsorConnect](https://sponsorconnect.dev), and clients with an Enterprise Support Contract for Prism via the [AvantiPoint](https://avantipoint.com) Package Feed.

Approval for complimentary access is not guaranteed, and I reserve the right to say no.

### FAQ

**Q.** What exactly is the Prism Magician?<br />
**A.** The Magician is a NuGet that provides several attributes to help you better compose your application. It contains several Roslyn Analyzers to help warn you when you make common mistakes, as well as combination of Code Generation *(where possible)* and IL weaving *(when necessary)* to help you reduce the amount of code that you need to write.

**Q.** How much do I have to spend as a Sponsor to get access to the Prism Magician?<br />
**A.** The minimum Sponsorship level I have is $5/month, and ALL Sponsorship levels qualify

**Q.** I'm already a Prism Patron, do I qualify?<br />
**A.** No. The Prism Patreon was deprecated at end of 2019. The only way for me to verify that you are a sponsor is for you to sponsor me directly on GitHub.

**Q.** I signed up as a sponsor but the Sponsor Connect portal says I'm still not authorized?<br />
**A.** Rather than deal with figuring out undocumented webhooks, I have a job that runs periodically. If you still have the same problem more than an hour after signing up as a GitHub Sponsor, please reach out to me.

**Q.** Are there docs for the Prism.Magician?<br />
**A.** Currently there are not as this is still a pre-release. It doesn't really have much of an API as it really only contains a single interface and several attributes. These are designed to be pretty self explanitory.
